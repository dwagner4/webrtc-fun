# Realtime communication with WebRTC

This uses a firebase Database as a signaling server.  Inspired by the technical literature that said we could use carrier pigeon (although latency may be an issue)

Frankly it is having problems with connecting.  It will link between two devices on my wifi.  Like my phone and a chromebook while being served from a firebase hosting site.

I have not sent audion or data yet.
